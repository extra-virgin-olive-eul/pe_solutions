## How to play: ##


* Clone this repo
* Add your solution:
	* If there's a pre-existing directory, put your solution in there and push to master [1]
	* No one submitted a solution for that one yet? Create a directory, add solution, push to master
* Is one of your solutions in a language that hasn't been represented here yet? Add it to the LANGUAGES list in README


Feel free to make your solutions as weird as you like. No language restrictions!


LANGUAGES
=========

* Python 2/3
* Clojure
* Rust
* gForth
* SAS 9.4

NOTES
=====
[1] Yes, this is not an ideal workflow. However, it might work okay with a small # of folks initially. I'll also gladly accept PRs!
