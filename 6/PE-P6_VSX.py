Project Euler Problem 6:
    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
    natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
    hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

There is a really good derived proof for a more efficient approach to
this problem in the Overview document you receive after submitting a
correct answer. I am not implementing that here, since it's not mine.
